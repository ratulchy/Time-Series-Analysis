# Time-Series-Analysis
In this project, we briefly summarize the usage of GARCH, ARCH and ARMA models in financial time series. Then, we plot a return series for Amazon US stocks along with Conditional Volatility and analyze the results. In the next segment, we chose four German companies, namely Allianz SE, Daimler AG, Deutsche Post AG, Heidelberg Cement AG, and plotted four different time series to depict the impact of Covid-19 on stock prices. A return series for the stock prices were also simulated along with their loss functions VaR (Value at Risk) and ES(Expected Shortfall).
